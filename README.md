<h1 align="center">Dry Bean Classification</h1>

<p align="center">This notebook details the creation of a classification model that aims to predict whether a job posting is real or fraudulent using natural language processing. The data can also be used to identify key traits of job descriptions that are fraudulent in nature.</p>

## Python Libraries Used

This project was written in Python 3.7.4 using the following libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- re
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- wordcloud
- scikit-learn

## Future Updates

- [ ] Address class imbalance by obtaining more samples or over-sampling fraudulent listings with imbalanced-learn RandomOverSampler
- [ ] Try other vectorization techniques (e.g. Word2Vec)
- [ ] Try BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
